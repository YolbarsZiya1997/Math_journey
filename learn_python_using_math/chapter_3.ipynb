    "#### In statistics, you'll often come across the statement \"correlation doesn't imply causation.\" This is a reminder that even two sets of observations are strongly correlated with each other, that doesn't mean one variable causes the other. When two variables are strongly correlated, somtimes there's a third factor that influences both variables and explains the correlation. A classic examole is the correlation between ice cream sales and crime rates--if you track both of these variables in a typical city, you're likely to find a correlation but this does not mean that ice cream sales cause crime(or vice versa). Ice cream sales and crime are correlated because they both go up as the weather gets hotter during the summer. OF course, this does not mean that hot weather directly causes crime to go up either; there are more complicated causes behind that correlation as well. "
